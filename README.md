grima
=======

Whisper into Alma's ear using APIs to speed up workflows. With grima,
you can use small web-based tools to do tasks like:
* View / Print a MARC record
* View bibs, holdings, items in a hierarchy
* Delete a bib and all of its inventory
* Create a boundwith
* Quickly add lots of similar items to a set or serial
* ... whatever else you want to write with the grima library!

## Getting started

First download the [most recent release](https://github.com/zemkat/grima/releases/latest).
Next see the [setup documentation](docs/INSTALL.md) for installing grima
on your web server and getting started using (and developing) grimas.
