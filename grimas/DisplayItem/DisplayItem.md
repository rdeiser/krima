# K-State Item Information - displays item information

This application facilitates the **Unboxing Workflow** by providing you with important information.  It provides you with the physical item's **Title**, **Call Number**, **Description**, **Barcode**, **Location**, **Process Type**, **Fulfillment Note**, and its final **Destination**.  The application is color coded to provide a stimulated eye response, so please review the color code table below.  After scanning your first barcode, you will be able to scan your next barcode from the results page.  If you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask Library Staff.

## Input
* Barcode of **Unboxed** physical item found from the outside cover, inside cover, or within the first 5 pages.  The barcode can be scanned in using the barcode scanner or typed in.  The search is not case sensitive.  

## Procedure
The first form asks for you to scan a barcode.  This barcode can be scanned with the barcode scanner or by being typed in.  When you have located the barcode on the physical piece, enter that barcode into the form:

The next form will display the **Unboxed** physical item information.  The **Destination** will display at the top of the page followed by **Title**, **Call Number**, **Description**, **Barcode**, **Location**, **Process Type**, **Fulfillment Note**, and the**Destination** again.  The background color of the form is related to the physical item's destination.  **Please review the color code table below.**  If the **Process Type** row has a background color of <span style="color:#cd3700">red</span> place the physical item on the **Problem Shelf**, ignoring the stated destination.  If the **Fulfillment Note** row has a background color of <span style="color:#cd3700">red</span> place the physical item on the **Problem Shelf**, ignoring the stated destination:
