# K-State LUS Fulfillment Scan In

This application facilitates the material returns by removing Item Record Temporary Location Information. The output provides you with the physical item's **Title, Location (i.e. Permanent Location Code), Call Number, Barcode, Process Type, Fulfillment Note, Inventory Date,** and its final **Destination (i.e. Permanent Library Description)**.  The application is color coded to provide a stimulated eye response, so please review the color code table below.  After scanning your first barcode, you will be able to scan your next barcode from the results page.  If you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask Library Staff.
